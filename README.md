# IGRINS Pipeline Package

IGRINS pipeline package is currently in active development. 

Current version of pipeline is developed by Prof. Soojong
Pak's team at Kyung Hee University. The pipeline is currently 
undergoing active development by a pipeline team at KASI 
(led by Dr. Jae-Joon Lee) in close collaboration with 
with Prof. Soojong Pak and his team.

This is still a work in progress. While the current pipeline works to
some extent, there are things that should be fixed/improved/extended.

We expect to release an improved version of the pipeline by early
August, which will include more reasonable wavelength calibration
feature.  We plan to include more rigorous telluric correction feature
in the pipeline but it won't ready this time.
